Simple TUI tetris implementation in rust

Controls:
a - counterclockwise rotation
s - put current piece as a spare piece (can do this once per piece)
d - clockwise rotation

<space> - drop the piece to the bottom

arrows - move piece
q - exit game


Probably some adjustment of the consts will be needed to look good on a given terminal
